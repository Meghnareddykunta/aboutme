Meghna Reddy Kunta

I am a new member of the spring 2019 working on my Masters of Applied Computer Science. I should be graduating in 2020.

I am from Hyderabad, India. I completed my undergraduation in computer science department from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological university Hyderabad. My hobbies are playing badminton, listening to music.

 I want to be a web developer and create my own web applications. I hope that by the end of my semester my course work would help me in achieving my goal.

Something interesting about me is I enjoy cooking.
